This  project is centering around making a marketting landing page for the TESS satelite launched by NASA in pursuit of finding new exoplanets in our universe.
The index.html is coving all elements in landing page with @phone entailing the media query given a breakpoint at 500px max width. The aboutt-us html covers the team page with every team member listed with their respective githubs linked to a github button. Everything in css has been labeled and every class name should be self explantory.
